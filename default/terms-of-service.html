                <h2>New Patient Terms and Conditions</h2>

                <hr style="margin: 30px 0;">

                <h3 style="color: #007bff; margin-top: 40px;">TERMS FOR PATIENTS AGED 16 AND OVER</h3>

                <h4>1. Introduction</h4>
                <p>1.1 These Terms and Conditions form the basis of the contract between you (the "Patient") and
                    Shenfield Private GP, product of Aesthetk Ltd (the "Practice") for the provision of private general
                    medical services ("Services").</p>
                <p>1.2 By registering with the Practice, booking an appointment, or using our Services, you agree to be
                    bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>
                <p>1.3 The Practice is regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC Provider ID: 1-18849302268) and
                    provides Services in accordance with relevant UK law, professional guidance and applicable
                    regulations.</p>

                <h4>2. Nature of Services</h4>
                <p>2.1 The Practice provides private general practice services including, but not limited to, face to
                    face consultations, telephone and video consultations, home visits, prescriptions, medical reports,
                    referrals, and preventative health checks.</p>
                <p>2.2 The Services are private and not funded by the NHS. They are intended to complement, not replace,
                    your NHS GP registration, and you are encouraged to remain registered with an NHS GP where eligible.
                </p>
                <p>2.3 The Practice cannot provide 24 hour emergency care or an out of hours urgent care service
                    equivalent to NHS 111 or A&E. In an emergency (for example, chest pain, severe shortness of breath,
                    stroke symptoms, heavy bleeding, collapse, or suspected sepsis), you must call 999 or attend your
                    nearest emergency department.</p>

                <h4>3. Registration and Eligibility</h4>
                <p>3.1 To register, you must complete a registration form and provide accurate personal and contact
                    details, including a valid email address and telephone number.</p>
                <p>3.2 The Practice may request photographic identification and proof of address, and for children,
                    evidence of parental responsibility where appropriate.</p>
                <p>3.3 The Practice reserves the right to decline or discontinue registration where, in the clinical or
                    operational opinion of the team, your needs would be better met by an alternative provider (for
                    example, highly complex medical needs beyond the scope of the Practice).</p>

                <h4>4. Appointments and Access</h4>
                <p>4.1 Appointments can be booked via telephone, online booking system or in person during opening hours
                    published by the Practice.</p>
                <p>4.2 You are responsible for booking an appointment length that reflects your needs; longer or
                    additional appointments may incur additional fees.</p>
                <p>4.3 The Practice will make reasonable efforts to offer appointments promptly but cannot guarantee
                    specific appointment times or immediate availability.</p>
                <p>4.4 If you are under 18, the Practice may require attendance with a parent or legal guardian unless a
                    clinician assesses you as competent to be seen alone in line with applicable guidance.</p>

                <h4>5. Fees, Billing and Payment</h4>
                <p>5.1 The Practice operates on a self pay basis (and/or membership/subscription model available). You
                    are responsible for all fees associated with consultations, investigations, procedures,
                    prescriptions, reports and other Services, unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>
                <p>5.2 Current fees (including consultation fees, membership fees where applicable, and common
                    investigation costs) are published in the Practice's fee schedule, available on the website or on
                    request. Fees are subject to change; updated fees will apply to future bookings.</p>
                <p>5.3 The Practice may require payment in advance of appointments or other Services. No Service is
                    guaranteed until payment is received.</p>
                <p>5.4 Where a third party (such as employer or insurer) has agreed to pay, you remain ultimately
                    responsible for payment if that third party declines or delays payment.</p>
                <p>5.5 Payment is accepted by debit/credit card, Stripe, Apple pay, Klarna, Bank transfer, etc. Cheques
                    or cash may be accepted only in exceptional cases and after agreement with the medical director.</p>

                <h4>6. Insurance</h4>
                <p>6.1 It is your responsibility to check with any private medical insurer whether our Services are
                    covered and under what conditions.</p>
                <p>6.2 The Practice is not obliged to invoice or deal directly with any insurer unless a prior written
                    agreement exists.</p>

                <h4>7. Cancellation, Non Attendance and Refunds</h4>
                <p>7.1 You may cancel or reschedule an appointment by giving at least 24 or 48 hours' notice.</p>
                <p>7.2 If you cancel with less than the required notice or do not attend, the Practice may charge a late
                    cancellation or non attendance fee up to the full appointment cost.</p>
                <p>7.3 Refunds for Services already provided are not usually given unless there has been an
                    administrative or billing error.</p>

                <h4>8. Prescriptions and Medicines</h4>
                <p>8.1 Prescribing is at the sole clinical discretion of the doctor or other prescriber. There is no
                    guarantee that any medication will be prescribed, or that a particular medicine or quantity will be
                    issued.</p>
                <p>8.2 Prescribers will only prescribe where it is clinically appropriate, safe and in the patient's
                    best interests, taking into account relevant guidance, your medical history, current medicines and
                    potential interactions.</p>
                <p>8.3 The Practice may not accept requests to prescribe controlled drugs, high risk medicines or long
                    term repeat medicines without appropriate clinical review and documentation.</p>
                <p>8.4 Private prescriptions may incur a dispensing fee and medicine cost charged by the pharmacy; these
                    are separate from Practice consultation fees.</p>

                <h4>9. Test Requests, Results and Referrals</h4>
                <p>9.1 The Practice can arrange private investigations (such as blood tests, imaging and other
                    diagnostics). The fees for tests are separate from consultation fees and may be set by third party
                    providers.</p>
                <p>9.2 The Practice will usually advise you how and when results will be communicated and whether a
                    follow up consultation is recommended or required to discuss results.</p>
                <p>9.3 Where clinically appropriate, the Practice may provide referrals to NHS or private specialists.
                    Acceptance of the referral and any associated costs are subject to the receiving provider's
                    policies.</p>
                <p>9.4 The Practice is not responsible for delays, cancellations or issues arising from services
                    provided by third parties (e.g. laboratories, imaging centres, hospitals), though reasonable efforts
                    will be made to liaise with them if problems arise.</p>

                <h4>10. Relationship with NHS Services</h4>
                <p>10.1 Use of the Practice's Services does not create or replace your NHS GP registration. You are
                    encouraged to register and remain registered with an NHS GP for continuity of care, access to NHS
                    prescriptions, long term monitoring and emergency services.</p>
                <p>10.2 The Practice may, with your consent and where appropriate, share relevant information with your
                    NHS GP or other NHS providers to support safe, coordinated care.</p>
                <p>10.3 All prescriptions of Controlled Drugs and Schedule 4 Medications will always be shared with your
                    NHS GP.</p>
                <p>10.4 The Practice cannot guarantee that all private advice, prescriptions or investigations will be
                    continued or accepted by NHS services, which may have different policies and clinical thresholds.
                </p>

                <h4>11. Conduct and Termination of Care</h4>
                <p>11.1 The Practice expects all patients and accompanying persons to behave in a respectful, non
                    abusive and non discriminatory manner toward staff and others on the premises.</p>
                <p>11.2 The Practice may refuse to provide or may terminate Services where there is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Threatening, abusive or violent behaviour.</li>
                    <li>Repeated non attendance or non payment.</li>
                    <li>Persistent failure to follow reasonable clinical or administrative advice.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>11.3 Where clinically safe and appropriate, reasonable notice will be given of termination of care
                    and, if needed, information will be provided to your NHS GP or another provider (with your consent)
                    to facilitate safe transfer of care.</p>

                <h4>12. Confidentiality and Data Protection</h4>
                <p>12.1 The Practice will handle your personal and medical information in accordance with UK data
                    protection law, including the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
                <p>12.2 Information will be kept confidential, except where disclosure is required by law, is necessary
                    to protect you or others from serious harm, or is required for regulatory purposes.</p>
                <p>12.3 You have rights regarding access, correction and, in some cases, deletion of your personal data,
                    as set out in the Practice <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

                <h4>13. Records and Communication</h4>
                <p>13.1 The Practice will keep an accurate and up to date medical record of your consultations and care.
                </p>
                <p>13.2 The Practice may communicate with you by telephone, SMS, email or secure online portal using the
                    contact details you provide. You are responsible for keeping these details up to date and for
                    informing the Practice of any changes.</p>
                <p>13.3 Email and SMS communications may not be fully secure. Sensitive clinical information will
                    usually be shared using encrypted emails (via Egress) and via other channels, only if you have been
                    informed of the risks and have consented or where there is no safer practical alternative.</p>

                <h4>14. Complaints and Feedback</h4>
                <p>14.1 The Practice operates a complaints procedure in line with regulatory requirements. Details of
                    how to raise concerns or complaints are available from reception or on the website.</p>
                <p>14.2 Complaints will be investigated and responded to within reasonable timescales.</p>
                <p>14.3 If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of a complaint, you may have the right to escalate it
                    to external bodies such as the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman or the relevant regulatory
                    authority; the Practice will provide details on request.</p>

                <h4>15. Liability</h4>
                <p>15.1 The Practice and its clinicians will exercise reasonable skill and care, complying with
                    professional standards and applicable law.</p>
                <p>15.2 Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by
                    negligence, fraud or any other liability that cannot be excluded under law.</p>
                <p>15.3 Subject to clause 15.2, the Practice's liability to you in connection with the provision of

                <h3 style="color: #007bff; margin-top: 40px;">TERMS FOR PATIENTS UNDER 16</h3>

                <h4>1. Parties and scope</h4>
                <p>1.1 This contract is between Shenfield Private GP, product of Aesthetk Ltd (the "Practice") and the
                    person with parental responsibility who registers the child (the "Parent/Guardian") for the
                    provision of private medical services to the child (the "Patient").</p>
                <p>1.2 By completing registration, booking an appointment or using the Practice's services for a Patient
                    under 16, the Parent/Guardian agrees to these Terms and Conditions on behalf of the Patient.</p>
                <p>1.3 The Practice provides various services including but not limited to, private GP services,
                    cosmetic and dermatology services, minor surgery services and associated administrative services.
                    These services are private and not funded by the NHS.</p>

                <h4>2. Parental responsibility and consent</h4>
                <p>2.1 At registration the Parent/Guardian must provide evidence of parental responsibility (for example
                    birth certificate, adoption or guardianship order) and their own identification and contact details.
                </p>
                <p>2.2 The Parent/Guardian confirms that they have legal authority to register the Patient, to provide
                    information on the Patient's behalf and, where the Patient is not competent to decide, to consent to
                    treatment and information-sharing.</p>
                <p>2.3 The Practice recognises that some young people under 16 may be assessed as competent to make
                    their own decisions (Gillick competence). Where a clinician judges the Patient to be competent, the
                    Patient may be seen alone and may be able to consent to treatment and control access to some
                    information, unless there is a risk of serious harm.</p>
                <p>2.4 In a medical emergency, or where required by law or to protect the Patient or others from serious
                    harm, the Practice may provide treatment or share information without prior consent from the
                    Parent/Guardian or Patient.</p>

                <h4>3. Registration, information and communication</h4>
                <p>3.1 The Parent/Guardian must ensure that all information provided at registration (including contact
                    details, medical history, safeguarding information and details of who has parental responsibility)
                    is accurate and kept up to date.</p>
                <p>3.2 The Parent/Guardian agrees to tell the Practice promptly about any changes in family
                    circumstances that may affect consent or parental responsibility (for example court orders, care
                    arrangements or safeguarding concerns).</p>
                <p>3.3 The Practice may communicate with the Parent/Guardian and/or the Patient (if competent and
                    appropriate) by phone, SMS, email or secure portal using the contact details provided, for
                    appointment, clinical and administrative purposes, in line with the Practice <a
                        href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Notice</a>.</p>

                <h4>4. Appointments and attendance</h4>
                <p>4.1 Appointments for Patients under 16 are usually booked and managed by a Parent/Guardian. The
                    Parent/Guardian is responsible for booking an appointment type and length which is suitable for the
                    Patient's needs; additional time may incur additional fees.</p>
                <p>4.2 The Practice normally requires a Parent/Guardian to attend with the Patient, unless a clinician
                    agrees that it is appropriate for the Patient to be seen alone (for example, a competent teenager
                    requesting confidential advice).</p>
                <p>4.3 The Practice does not provide 24-hour emergency care. In a medical emergency, the Parent/Guardian
                    must call 999 or attend the nearest emergency department.</p>

                <h4>5. Fees, payment and insurance</h4>
                <p>5.1 The Parent/Guardian is responsible for all fees for consultations, investigations, procedures,
                    reports, prescriptions and other services provided to the Patient, even if an insurer or third party
                    does not pay.</p>
                <p>5.2 Current fees are set out in the Practice fee schedule. Fees may change; the fee in place at the
                    time of booking will apply to that appointment.</p>
                <p>5.3 The Practice will require payment at booking or on the day of the appointment. The Clinic does
                    not deal with third-party insurers but we will provide you with an invoice for you to make your own
                    request for reimbursement under the terms of your insurance.</p>

                <h4>6. Cancellations and non-attendance</h4>
                <p>6.1 Appointments can be cancelled or rescheduled by giving at least 24-48 hours' notice (as per the
                    Practice policy).</p>
                <p>6.2 If the Patient does not attend or if the Parent/Guardian cancels with less than the required
                    notice, the Practice may charge a late-cancellation or non-attendance fee up to the full appointment
                    cost.</p>
                <p>6.3 Appointments can be cancelled or rescheduled by giving at least 24 hours' notice (as per the
                    Practice policy). Your fee will be refunded less £5 administration charge.</p>
                <p>6.4 Repeated non-attendance or late cancellations may lead to restrictions on future bookings or
                    termination of registration where it is safe and reasonable to do so.</p>

                <h4>7. Clinical care, prescriptions and tests</h4>
                <p>7.1 All treatment decisions, including whether to prescribe medicines or request tests, are at the
                    clinician's professional discretion. There is no guarantee that any particular medicine, test or
                    procedure will be provided.</p>
                <p>7.2 For cosmetic and minor surgery procedures in under-16s, the Practice will only proceed where this
                    is clinically and ethically appropriate, lawful, and supported by informed consent from the
                    Parent/Guardian and, where competent, the Patient.</p>
                <p>7.3 Private prescriptions may incur a dispensing fee and medicine cost charged by the pharmacy,
                    separate from Practice fees. Laboratory and imaging tests arranged privately may also incur separate
                    provider charges.</p>

                <h4>8. Information sharing and NHS services</h4>
                <p>8.1 The Practice strongly recommends that the Patient remains registered with an NHS GP wherever
                    eligible. NHS providers may not automatically continue treatments started privately.</p>
                <p>8.2 It is Clinic Policy to share details of every consultation of patients under 16 with your NHS GP.
                    Where appropriate and with consent, we may also share with hospital specialists, school nursing
                    teams or other providers involved in the Patient's care, in line with the Practice Privacy Notice
                    and safeguarding duties.</p>
                <p>8.3 If the Patient is assessed as competent and requests that certain information is not shared with
                    a Parent/Guardian, the clinician will consider this request in line with legal and professional
                    guidance and may keep some information confidential where this is judged to be in the Patient's best
                    interests and does not place the Patient or others at significant risk.</p>

                <h4>9. Behaviour, safeguarding and termination of care</h4>
                <p>9.1 The Practice expects all patients, parents/guardians and anyone accompanying them to treat staff
                    and other patients with courtesy and respect at all times. Unacceptable behaviour includes, but is
                    not limited to, verbal abuse, shouting, harassment, discrimination, threats, intimidation, damage to
                    property and any form of physical violence.</p>
                <p>9.2 The Practice has statutory and professional safeguarding duties towards children and young
                    people. If any member of staff has concerns that a child may be at risk of abuse, neglect or
                    exploitation, those concerns may be shared with safeguarding partners (for example local authority
                    children's services, health professionals, police or school staff) in line with national
                    safeguarding guidance and law, even without parental consent where necessary to protect the child or
                    others.</p>
                <p>9.3 The Practice may, where it is safe and lawful to do so, restrict services or terminate the
                    Patient's registration if there is persistent non attendance, repeated non payment of fees, serious
                    or sustained abusive behaviour by the Parent/Guardian or Patient, or a breakdown of trust such that
                    safe care cannot reasonably be delivered. If registration is ended, the Practice will, where
                    appropriate, provide reasonable notice and information to support continuity of care via the
                    Patient's NHS GP or another provider, subject to safeguarding considerations and the Patient's best
                    interests.</p>

                <h4>10. Confidentiality and Data Protection</h4>
                <p>10.1 The Practice will handle your personal and medical information in accordance with UK data
                    protection law, including the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018.</p>
                <p>10.2 Information will be kept confidential, except where disclosure is required by law, is necessary
                    to protect you or others from serious harm, or is required for regulatory purposes.</p>
                <p>10.3 You have rights regarding access, correction and, in some cases, deletion of your personal data,
                    as set out in the Practice Privacy Notice.</p>

                <h4>11. Records and Communication</h4>
                <p>11.1 The Practice will keep an accurate and up to date medical record of your consultations and care.
                    Private practices typically maintain separate records even where you remain registered with an NHS
                    GP.</p>
                <p>11.2 The Practice may communicate with you by telephone, SMS, email or secure online portal using the
                    contact details you provide. You are responsible for keeping these details up to date and for
                    informing the Practice of any changes.</p>
                <p>11.3 Email and SMS communications may not be fully secure. Sensitive clinical information will
                    usually be shared using encrypted emails (via Egress) and via other channels, only if you have been
                    informed of the risks and have consented or where there is no safer practical alternative.</p>

                <h4>12. Complaints and Feedback</h4>
                <p>12.1 The Practice operates a complaints procedure in line with regulatory requirements. Details of
                    how to raise concerns or complaints are available from reception or on the website.</p>
                <p>12.2 Complaints will be investigated and responded to within reasonable timescales.</p>
                <p>12.3 If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of a complaint, you may have the right to escalate it
                    to external bodies such as the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman or the relevant regulatory
                    authority; the Practice will provide details on request.</p>

                <h4>13. Liability</h4>
                <p>13.1 The Practice and its clinicians will exercise reasonable skill and care, complying with
                    professional standards and applicable law.</p>
                <p>13.2 Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes liability for death or personal injury caused by
                    negligence, fraud or any other liability that cannot be excluded under law.</p>
                <p>13.3 Subject to clause 13.2, the Practice’s liability to you in connection with the provision of
                    Services is limited to reasonably foreseeable loss or damage arising directly from any breach of
                    duty.</p>

                <h4>14. Changes to Terms and Conditions</h4>
                <p>14.1 These Terms and Conditions may be updated from time to time. The current version will be
                    available on the Practice website or from reception.</p>
                <p>14.2 Material changes will, where practicable, be notified to registered patients. Continued use of
                    the Services after such notification will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

                <h4>15. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h4>
                <p>15.1 These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of England and Wales.</p>
                <p>15.2 Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive
                    jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.</p>
